# Welcome

Hello, my name is Justin Vastola, and welcome to my Jekyll site! This Jekyll example site was made possible thanks to the template by cotes2020 on GitHub:

# What is this Post?

This is really just an example of using Jekyll - a static site generator. A static site generator, such as Jekyll, is particularly useful when it comes to hosting documentation for technical writing.
